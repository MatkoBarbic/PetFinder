Solution for Kaggle PetFinder competition

Competition link: "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-pawpularity-score"

The competition was hosted by PetFinder.my, a Malaysiaâ€™s leading animal welfare platform. The goal of the competition is to create an AI model that can predict a "Pawpularity" of animals in the picture. A "Pawpularity" of an animal is a number from 0 to 100 and it determines how likely a person is to click on an image of the animal. The idea of the AI model is to provide feedback regarding photo quality to people posting animal pictures to the website. 

The dataset consists of 9912 annotated images. The best model tried ended up being EfficientB0 with root mean squared error of 21.3283. Since this was my first AI project I am pleased with the obtained results.
